# Modeling Late Payments for Credit Card Bills

The aim of this project is to predict whether a customer will delay his/her credit card bill payment more than 1 day (named as target1), more than 31 days (named as target2), or more than 61 days (named as target3) using the information given about each customer.

After trying many different algorithms, I decided to use Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) since it had the best results for the validation set.
